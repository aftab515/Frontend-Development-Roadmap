# Introduction:

Front-end development involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a client-side application. The client-side of an online application is the visual part of a web application and also what a user interacts with when an application is opened: colours, fonts, buttons, navigations, animations, etc.

[Introduction To Front End &nbsp; 🎬](https://youtu.be/6meCVoEo18o) &nbsp; <img src="https://badgen.net/badge/Recommended/PR/blue" width="80" />

Front-end development includes the user interface of an application. Everything a user interacts with when a user visits a website such as a login or sign-up page, homepage, contact page falls under the front-end development term.

A front-end developer is responsible for building and implementing the interface of a website or web application. They build client-side applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In 2021 however, front-end development has gone beyond HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are a lot of web technologies you need to learn to be able to excel as a front-end developer this year.

> I will endeavor to cover all you need to get started with front-end development in 2023.

# Before you start:

First, you should read about [The Front-end Developer Profession &nbsp; 📄 ](https://frontendmasters.com/guides/learning-roadmap/front-end-developer-profession/)

## After this section, you should know:

- Front-end Developer Role
- Required Skills
- Job Titles

---

# Front-end Development Tech/Spec Overview

## In this section, you will learn about *Internet* and should know:

- The World Wide Web (aka WWW)
- Internet Fundamentals &  How it Works
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (aka HTTP)
- Uniform Resource Locators (aka URL)
- Browsers and How The Web Works
- DNS, Domain Name and Hosting

# Required for any path:

There are some tools required for any path such as Basic Terminal Usage (Command line), Git - Version Control & Github.

`Note:`

> **Learn these tools in parallel with the rest of the courses**.

## Basic Terminal Usage (Command line)

The terminal is an interface used to execute text commands, and it gives you access to the underlying operating system. Basic terminal usage is a skill all developers need regardless of their specialization. Command line is very important so I strongly recommend you study more on how to use it.

> If you are on windows like me, I recommend using [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

**Here are some resources to learn command line:**

- [Command line crash course &nbsp; 📄 ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line)

## Git - Version Control

Git is a version control system that enables developers to track changes in their project. Git also helps developers collaborate as a team. Git is needed among developers, to ensure that there are no code conflicts between developers.

## Github

GitHub is a code hosting platform for software development. GitHub lets teams work together on projects and it is also used for version control. It can be used among teams to collaborate on a project. For example, a team of developers wants to build a web application and everyone is given a task that has to be updated daily while working on the project, in this case, Github helps them build a centralized repository where each team member can make updates or manage the code file or repository.
